************
Introduction
************

The Python client library for `CrateDB`_ implements the Python Database API
Specification v2.0 (`PEP 249`_).

The Python driver can be used to connect to both `CrateDB`_ and `CrateDB
Cloud`_, and is verified to work on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It is used by
the `Crash CLI`_, as well as other libraries and applications connecting to
CrateDB from the Python ecosystem. It is verified to work with CPython, but
it has also been tested successfully with `PyPy`_.

Please make sure to also visit the section about :ref:`other-options`, using
the :ref:`crate-reference:interface-postgresql` interface of `CrateDB`_.

The :ref:`CrateDB dialect <using-sqlalchemy>` for `SQLAlchemy`_ is provided
by the ``sqlalchemy-cratedb`` package.

For general help about the Python Database API, please consult `PEP 249`_.
For more detailed information about how to install the client driver, how to
connect to a CrateDB cluster, and how to run queries, consult the resources
referenced below.

DB API
======

Install package from PyPI.

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install crate

Connect to CrateDB instance running on ``localhost``.

.. code-block:: python

    # Connect using DB API.
    from crate import client
    from pprint import pp

    query = "SELECT country, mountain, coordinates, height FROM sys.summits ORDER BY country;"
    
    with client.connect("localhost:4200", username="crate") as connection:
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute(query)
        pp(cursor.fetchall())
        cursor.close()

Connect to `CrateDB Cloud`_.

.. code-block:: python

    # Connect using DB API.
    from crate import client
    connection = client.connect(
        servers="https://example.aks1.westeurope.azure.cratedb.net:4200",
        username="admin",
        password="<PASSWORD>")


Data types
==========

The DB API driver supports :ref:`CrateDB's data types
<crate-reference:data-types>` to different degrees. For more information,
please consult the :ref:`data-types` documentation page.

Examples
========

- The :ref:`by-example` section enumerates concise examples demonstrating the
  different API interfaces of the CrateDB Python client library. Those are
  DB API, HTTP, and BLOB interfaces.
- Executable code examples are maintained within the `cratedb-examples repository`_.
- The `sample application`_ and the corresponding `sample application
  documentation`_ demonstrate the use of the driver on behalf of an example
  "guestbook" application.
- ``sqlalchemy-cratedb`` has relevant code snippets about how to
  connect to CrateDB using `SQLAlchemy`_, `pandas`_, and `Dask`_.
- `Use CrateDB with pandas`_ has corresponding code snippets about how to
  connect to CrateDB using `pandas`_, and how to load and export data.
- The `Apache Superset`_ and `FIWARE QuantumLeap data historian`_ projects.
