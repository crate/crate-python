Changes for crate
=================

Unreleased
==========

- The client now allows to define a different default schema when connecting to
  CrateDB with the ``schema`` keyword argument. This causes all statements and
  queries that do not specify a schema explicitly to use the provided schema.

- BREAKING: Dropped support for Python 2.7 and 3.3
  If you are using crate with Python 2.7 or 3.3 already, you will not be able
  to install newer versions of this package.

- Updated ``get_table_names()`` method in SqlAlchemy dialect to only return
  tables but not views.

- Added configuration for the sphinx_sitemap extension which allows to
  create a sitemap.xml from the documentation.

2018/03/14 0.21.3
