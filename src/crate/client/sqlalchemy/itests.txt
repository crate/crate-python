==================
SQLAlchemy Dialect
==================

    >>> connection = engine.connect()

Using the connection to execute a select statement::

    >>> result = connection.execute('select name from locations order by name')
    >>> result.rowcount
    13

    >>> result.first()
    (u'Aldebaran',)

Using the ORM to query the locations::

    >>> locations = session.query(Location)
    >>> [l.name for l in locations if l is not None][:2]
    [u'Alpha Centauri', u'Galactic Sector QQ7 Active J Gamma']

With limit and offset::

    >>> locations = session.query(Location).offset(1).limit(2)
    >>> [l.name for l in locations if l is not None]
    ['Galactic Sector QQ7 Active J Gamma', 'Allosimanius Syneca']

With filter::

    >>> location = session.query(Location).filter_by(name='Algol').one()
    >>> location.name
    u'Algol'

Order by::

    >>> locations = session.query(Location).order_by(sa.desc(Location.name))
    >>> locations = locations.limit(2)
    >>> [l.name for l in locations]
    [u'Outer Eastern Rim', u'North West Ripple']


Insert a new location::

    >>> location = Location()
    >>> location.name = 'Earth'
    >>> location.kind = 'Planet'
    >>> location.flag = True

    >>> session.add(location)
    >>> session.flush()

Currently refresh option is missing, therefore sleep for now::

    >>> from time import sleep
    >>> sleep(1)

Inserted location is available::

    >>> location = session.query(Location).filter_by(name='Earth').one()
    >>> location.name
    u'Earth'

Retrieve the location from the database::

    >>> session.refresh(location)
    >>> location.name
    u'Earth'

Date should have been set at the insert due to default value via python method::

    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> now = datetime.utcnow()
    >>> dt = location.date

    >>> dt.year == now.year
    True

    >>> dt.month == now.month
    True

    >>> dt.day == now.day
    True

    >>> (now - location.datetime).seconds < 4
    True

Verify the return type of date and datetime::

    >>> type(location.date)
    <type 'datetime.date'>

    >>> type(location.datetime)
    <type 'datetime.datetime'>

the location also has a date and datetime property which both are nullable and
aren't set when the row is inserted as there is no default method::

    >>> location.nullable_datetime is None
    True

    >>> location.nullable_date is None
    True

The datetime and date can be set using a update statement::

    >>> location.nullable_date = datetime.today()
    >>> location.nullable_datetime = datetime.utcnow()
    >>> session.flush()
    >>> sleep(1.1)  # wait for index refresh

Boolean values get set natively::

    >>> location.flag
    True

Reload the object from the db::

    >>> session.refresh(location)

And verify that the date and datetime was persisted::

    >>> location.nullable_datetime is not None
    True

    >>> location.nullable_date is not None
    True

Update one Location via raw sql::

    >>> result = connection.execute("update locations set name='Mother Earth' where name='Earth'")
    >>> result.rowcount
    1

Update multiple Locations::

    >>> for x in range(10):
    ...     loc = Location()
    ...     loc.name = 'Ort %d' % x
    ...     loc.kind = 'Update'
    ...     session.add(loc)
    ...     session.flush()

    >>> sleep(2)  # give crate some time to settle

    >>> result = connection.execute("update locations set name='Kein Ort, nirgends.' where kind='Update'")
    >>> result.rowcount
    10

Check that number of affected documents of update without ``where-clause`` matches number of all
documents in the table::

    >>> result = connection.execute(u"update locations set kind='Ãœberall'")
    >>> result.rowcount == connection.execute("select * from locations limit 100").rowcount
    True

    >>> session.commit()
    >>> sleep(2)  # give crate some time to settle

Test that objects can be used as list too::

    >>> location = session.query(Location).filter_by(name='Folfanga').one()
    >>> location.details = [{'size': 'huge'}, {'clima': 'cold'}]

    >>> session.commit()
    >>> session.refresh(location)

    >>> location.details
    [{u'size': u'huge'}, {u'clima': u'cold'}]

Update the clima::

    >>> location.details[1] = {'clima': 'hot'}

    >>> session.commit()
    >>> session.refresh(location)

    >>> location.details
    [{u'size': u'huge'}, {u'clima': u'hot'}]
