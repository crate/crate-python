==========
Connection
==========

    >>> from crate.client import connect

We create a new connection object::

    >>> connection = connect("dummy server", client_class=ClientMocked)

Calling the ``cursor()`` function on the connection will
return a cursor object::

    >>> cursor = connection.cursor()

Now we are able to perform any operation provided by the
cursor object::

    >>> cursor.rowcount
    -1

Now we close the connection::

    >>> connection.close()

The connection will be unusable from this point. Any
operation attempted with the closed connection will
raise a ``ProgrammingError``::

    >>> cursor = connection.cursor()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ProgrammingError

    >>> cursor.execute('')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ProgrammingError

    >>> connection.commit()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ProgrammingError

    >>> connection = connect("dummy server")
    >>> cursor = connection.cursor()
    >>> cursor.rowcount
    -1
